# My AVR Microcontroller Playground

I use this repository for the programs I write for AVR microcontroller. I am trying to cover as many subjects as possible. So far I have covered the basic IO, USART, I2C, timers/counter and interrupts. I try to work on interesting example problems such as IMU orientation sensing, ultrasonic car parking system, etc.
